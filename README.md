# Stock_ETL
A beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to build a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the [yFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) API. The script fetches historical stock data, computes moving averages, summarizes key financial statistics, and exports the results to CSV files.
